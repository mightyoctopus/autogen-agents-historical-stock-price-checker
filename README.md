# Code Writing Agent system

This is an agent-based system that automatically writes code to fetch and analyze past stock prices.

## Agent Structure
1. Coder Agent: Search and fetch historical stock prices, install required modules(Pandas, yFinance etc), and write the code to generate an image that displays price changes.
2. Executor Agent: Checks the result of each step done by Coder Agent and creates code resources such as the folder and files that contain the codebase.
